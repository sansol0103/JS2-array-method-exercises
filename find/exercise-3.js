Exercise 3: Finding a blog post using an ID

This exercise is similar to the last. We are going to find
a person using the '.find()' array method, however we will
need to check two separate values this time.

This time round there is a much larget set of data that
is over 1000 lines of code. You can have a quick look at the file,
'exercise-3-data.js', which is in the same diectory as this file.

You will need to find a todo that has the following properties:
  userId: 3,
  id: 43,

*/
import { todos } from './exercise-3-data.js';

const foundTodo = todos.find((todo) => todo.userId === 3 && todo.id === 43);

console.log(foundTodo);
