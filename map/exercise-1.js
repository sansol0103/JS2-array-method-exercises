/*
Exercise 1: Multiply by 2

There is an array called 'values' that contains
a set of values.

Use the .map array method to loop through the
'values' array and multiply each value by 2.

A new variable 'valuesTimesTwo' has been provided for
you. Set this variable to the .map array method you created.

*/

const values = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];

const valuesTimesTwo = null; // Replace null and add .map code here

console.log(valuesTimesTwo);
