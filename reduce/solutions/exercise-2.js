/*
Exercise 2: Total cost of items

Calculate the total cost of all the items using .reduce.

A list of items ('items') has been provided.

Each item has a number of items as well as a price.

Calculate the total cost of all items, taking into account
how many items are in stock.

A variable 'totalCost' has been provided for you. You must
set the result of your .reduce to this variable.

Tip: Calculate the cost for a single item by multiplying
the items in stock ('itemsInStock') by the price ('price')

Tip: Don't forget to set the initial value to 0

const items = [
  {
    name: 'Apple',
    itemsInStock: 10,
    price: 5.99,
  },
  {
    name: 'Banana',
    itemsInStock: 5,
    price: 3.99,
  },
  {
    name: 'Orange',
    itemsInStock: 2,

  },
];

const totalCostOfItems = items.reduce((totalCost, item) => {
  totalCost += item.itemsInStock * item.price;
  return totalCost;
}, 0);

// You could destructure the properties from 'item'. This can
// arguably become more readable.
const totalCostOfItemsDestructured = items.reduce(
  (totalCost, { itemsInStock, price }) => {
    totalCost += itemsInStock * price;
