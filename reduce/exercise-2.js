/*
Exercise 2: Total cost of items

Calculate the total cost of all the items using .reduce.

A list of items ('items') has been provided.

Each item has a number of items as well as a price.

Calculate the total cost of all items, taking into account
how many items are in stock.

A variable 'totalCostOfItems' has been provided for you. You must
set the result of your .reduce to this variable.

Tip: Calculate the cost for a single item by multiplying
the items in stock ('itemsInStock') by the price ('price')
